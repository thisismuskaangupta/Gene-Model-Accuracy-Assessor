1. ToxoDB-68_TgondiiME49.gff - This is the GFF file retrieved from ToxoDB, for the newer _T. gondii_ annotation (b68).

2. whole_genome_with_introns.gff - This is the above GFF file with introns added in.

3. introns_only.gff - This is the GFF file containing all intron features in the annotation across the whole genome.

The genome fasta file may be obtained from the following link - https://toxodb.org/common/downloads/release-68/TgondiiME49/fasta/data/ToxoDB-68_TgondiiME49_Genome.fasta

(At the time of writing this README, ToxoDB is offline because NIH funding from NIAID has ended. While the website will be online soon, if any user needs the genome file in the meantime, they may email me and I'm happy to send it! My email is muskaangupta0210@gmail.com.)
